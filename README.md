**Description of the RSF Slider:**

This is the Range Selection Filtering (RSF) Slider:
We presented it supports the users getting multiple levels of overview of the data being analyzed and filtering according to multiple ranges.
We combined the features of multiple slider types, i.e., histogram, interactive legends, standard, and multi-thumb sliders.
Moreover, we increased its usefulness and its ease of use by repositioning the thumbs to overcome the overlapping of thumbs and adapting 
the orientation of the thumbsâ€™ icons and introducing the cascading effect concept and applying it. This led to reducing the amount of interaction.
The paper can be found in the CGCVIP proceedings.


The code is provided for public usage and any further improvements are very welcome.
